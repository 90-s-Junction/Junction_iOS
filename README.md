Handlit - Driving simulation service for probationary drivers

## üí≠ Barrier-Free as we thought

---

In order to build a mature society where all citizens can naturally participate in society (each life of work, family, community), reducing and removing physical and psychological barriers that hinder participation. 
Something that can be enjoyed or used without difficulty(barrier) for both persons with disabilities and non-disabilities.

## üå± Target

---

Person who feel the barrier about New thing or something unfamiliar.
and who have temporal physically barrier.
(a person who has not had much time to get a license, a person who has a FOB, or a person who does not have enough time to go to driving training)

## ü§î Challenges that Targets face

---

According to the "Study on Policy Measures to Reduce Beginner Driver Accidents" published by the Traffic Climate Environment Research Institute, novice drivers have the highest accident rate (39.6%) in their first year of driving. The 100th day from the start date of driving was analyzed as the most dangerous time.
Only 36.4% of drivers get a driver's license and drive right away. 22% started driving a year later, and even 18% of drivers first started driving five years later after they got license.

- It's hard to get to a driving place or to make a time.
- Get out of the road in a mental strain on directly.
